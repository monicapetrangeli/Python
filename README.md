# Exercises
  # Exercise 1
Write a Python program that prints a greeting message, such as "Hello, Python!"

  # Exercise 2
Create a program that:
1. Defines two variables, a and b, with numerical values.
2. Prints their sum, difference, product, and quotient
   
  # Exercise 3
1. Define a variable name and assign it your name.
2. Write a program that prints a message saying "Hello, [name]!" where [name] is the value of the variable.
   
  # Exercise 4
1. Create a list called universities with at least five different university names.
2. Print the entire list.
3. Print the first and last university in the list.

  # Exercise 5
1. Create a dictionary called student with keys: name, age, and grade, and assign appropriate values to each key.
2. Write a program that prints each key-value pair in the dictionary

  # Exercise 6
1. Define a tuple called coordinates with two values representing a point in 2D space (e.g., (x, y)).
2. Print the value of coordinates and access each element by its index.

  # Exercise 7
1. Create a set called colors with the values: "red", "green", "blue".
2. Add another color to the set.
3. Try adding a duplicate color and observe what happens.
4. Print the set and remove one color from it.
5. Create another set named light_colors and merge colors and light_colors.

  # Exercise 8
Write a program that:
1. Takes an input number from the user.
2. Checks if the number is positive, negative, or zero.
3. Prints an appropriate message based on the result.

  # Exercise 9
1. Create a list of numbers from 1 to 5.
2. Use a for loop to iterate through the list and print each number.

  # Exercise 10
1. Write a program that uses a while loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.
2. Ensure the loop terminates correctly

  # Exercise 11
Write a program that:
1. Asks the user to input a grade (e.g., "A", "B", "C", "D", or "F").
2. Use a match statement to print a corresponding message for each grade:
    "A": "Excellent!"
    "B": "Good job!"
    "C": "Fair."
    "D": "Needs improvement."
    "F": "Failing."
3. Handle invalid input by printing a default message.

  # Exercise 12
1. Write a function called greet that takes a name as an argument and prints "Hello, [name]!".
2. Call the function with your own name.

  # Exercise 13
1. Define a function called square that takes a number as an argument and returns its square.
2. Print the result of calling this function with different numbers.

  # Exercise 14
1. Write a function called multiply that takes two parameters, a and b, and returns their product. Set a default value of 1 for the parameter b.
2. Test the function with and without providing the second argument.

  # Exercise 15
1. Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
2. Use list comprehension to create a new list that contains the squares of these numbers.
3. Print the new list.

  # Exercise 16
1. Create a dictionary where the keys are students' names and the values are lists of their grades.
2. Write a function that takes the dictionary and prints the average grade for each student

  # Exercise 17
Write a program that:
1. Defines a function calculate which takes three parameters: two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /).
2. Performs the operation and returns the result.
3. Ask the user for the two numbers and the operator, then call the function and print the result
