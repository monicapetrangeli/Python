# Python
The following repository aims to portray my growth through my journey in a new programming language, python.
The overall requisite to duplicate the exercises throughout this repository is having Python version 3.12.4 installed.
  
# Assignment 1
The first file, exercises lecture 1.py, contains a series of Python exercises from the first lecture in the course. The exercises focus on foundational Python concepts, including variables, data types, control structures, and basic data structures.
No additional libraries are required to run this file.

- Exercises Included 
1. Basic Print Statement: Prints a simple "Hello, World!" message.
2. Arithmetic Operations: Demonstrates basic arithmetic with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
3. String Formatting: Uses f-strings to dynamically print variables in a message.
4. Lists: Introduces list creation and indexing.
5. Dictionaries: Demonstrates key-value storage and iteration through a dictionary.
6. Tuples: Explains tuple usage and immutability with coordinate storage.
7. Sets: Shows set operations, including adding, removing, and merging sets.
8. Conditional Statements: Introduces basic conditional statements (if-elif-else).
9. List Comprehensions: Demonstrates list creation using comprehensions.
10. Loops: Uses for loops to iterate over data structures.

# Assignment 2
Thi second file, exercises lecture 2.py, continues the Python exercises with a focus on developing functions, applying conditional statements, and manipulating lists with more advanced techniques.
No additional libraries are required to run this file.

- Exercises Included 
1. FizzBuzz Function: Implements a fizzbuzz function to print "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5.
2. Filtering Integers from Mixed Data: Uses list comprehension to filter and create a list containing only integer values from a mixed-data list.
3. To-Do List Application: Defines functions for a basic to-do list, including add_task to add items and show_tasks to display the list.
4. Temperature Conversion: Defines a function celsius_to_fahrenheit to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit and prints the converted values.

# Assignment 3
This notebook, exercises lecture 3.ipynb, covers fundamental concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which are critical for structuring complex applications in Python, particularly in data science contexts. Topics include classes, objects, and key OOP principles like inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism.
No additional libraries are required to run this file.

- Topics Covered 
1. Classes and Objects: Introduction to defining classes and creating instances (objects) to represent real-world entities in code.
2. Abstraction and Inheritance: Explains how to abstract common features and behaviors into base classes and inherit them in derived classes.
3. Polymorphism and Encapsulation: Covers polymorphism for flexible function and method definitions and encapsulation for data protection within classes.

# Assignment 4
This notebook, exercises lecture 4.ipynb, introduces the following libraries:
a. numpy
b. scipy
c. mathplotlib
d. math
e. os
f. glob
g. shutil

- Topics covered 
1. Numerical operations: implementing numerical operations within a multidimensional array of objects.
2. Files handling: Learning how to implement the os, glob and shutil libraries to interact with files, folders and directories.

# Assignment 6
This notebook, exercises lecture 6.ipynb, covers topics such as defining classes, creating objects, and key OOP principles to further strengthen our understanding of the language.
Pandas library is required when running the following document. The import of netflix_titles.csv and train_and_test2.csv is also required as they represent the datasets that we'll be working on.

- Topics covered 
1. Classes and Objects
     - Introduction to defining classes in Python.
     - Demonstrates how to create instances (objects) to represent real-world entities in code.
     - Emphasizes methods and attributes to encapsulate behavior and properties.
2. Abstraction and Inheritance
     - Explains the concept of abstraction to focus on essential features.
     - Shows how to design base (parent) classes to abstract shared characteristics.
     - Illustrates inheritance, where derived (child) classes extend or customize the behavior of parent classes.
3. Polymorphism and Encapsulation
     - Covers polymorphism to enable flexible methods that behave differently based on the context (e.g., method overriding).
     - Highlights encapsulation as a mechanism to restrict direct access to class properties and ensure controlled interactions via methods.

# Assignment 7
This notebook, exercises lecture 7.ipynb, covers topics such as handling missing data and performing transformations.
Pandas library is required when running the following document. This helps further develop our understanding of how to manipulate datasets, a skill required when analyzing data.

- Topics covered
1. Lambda and map Functions
   - Introduction to using anonymous functions with lambda.
   - Application of map for element-wise transformations on data structures.
2. Working with Series
  - Techniques for manipulating Pandas Series objects.
  - Examples showcasing indexing, slicing, and common operations.
3. Advanced Data Manipulation
  - Methods for reshaping and restructuring datasets.
  - Performing operations like merging, concatenation, and pivoting.
4. Handling Missing Data and Transformations
  - Strategies to deal with missing values (e.g., imputation, filtering).
  - Data transformation methods for scaling, normalizing, and applying conditional logic.
